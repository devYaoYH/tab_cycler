# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon

You can create these icons with any image editor. The icons should represent the tab cycling functionality, such as:
- Circular arrows indicating cycling
- Tab symbols with arrows
- Clock or timer symbols

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show default placeholder icons.
